📋 Internship Summary – GrapheneAI
Welcome to the official documentation of the work I completed during my internship at **GrapheneAI** as a **Database Intern**. This README outlines the tasks, tools, technologies, and skills I developed while working on real-time enterprise data workflows, system automation, and database management.

👩‍💻
Position: Database Intern  
Organization: Graphene Health Tech Private Limited 
Duration: 27/01/2025 – 31/05/2025 

🧠 Key Responsibilities

- ✅ Developed a Tkinter-based GUI for interactive data upload from CSV to SQL Server with options to Truncate, Append, or Delete.
- ✅ Handled user authentication for secure SQL Server access (migrated from Windows to SQL Auth).
- ✅ Created modular Python scripts for file validation, table matching, and query execution.
- ✅ Built unit test cases using Python `unittest` to ensure robustness of individual upload functions.
- ✅ Worked with real-world datasets and ensured schema compatibility and data integrity.
- ✅ Wrote **SQL scripts and stored procedures for data cleaning, transformation, and automation.
- ✅ Managed SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) for DB operations, backups, and table inspection.
